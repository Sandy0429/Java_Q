Time Limit: 2 sec
Memory Limit: 128000 kB

Problem Statement
Take input from standard input while you do not get 0 as an input. Print all the inputs separated by space. It is guaranteed that the number of integers are less than 100000.

Input
The input will contain a series of integers in one line each. Input should be taken while you have not get a 0 as an input.

0 <= input <= 10

Output
Print the input integers seperated by space.
