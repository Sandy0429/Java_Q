Problem Statement
Two arrays of size N are given, A and B.
Determine whether the sum of Ai*Bi for all i such that (1<=i<=N).

Input
The first line contains one integer N.
The second line contains N integers A1, A2 ... AN.
The third line contains N integers B1, B2 ... BN.

Constraints
1≤N≤100000
100≤Ai≤100
100≤Bi ≤100

All values in input are integers.

Output
If the inner product of A and B is 0, print Yes; otherwise, print No.

Example
