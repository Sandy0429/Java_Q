Problem Statement
Bob has a fantasy for integer 200. He has an integer N and wants you to do the given operation K times and print the result.

Operation:
1. Add 200 to the end of it, if N is not divisible by 200.
2. Otherwise divide it by 200.

For example, 6 would become 6200 and 434 would become 434200.

Input
The first line contains two integers N and K.

Constraints
All values in the input are integers.
1≤N≤10 ^ 5
1≤K≤20

Output
Print the answer as an integer.

Example
Sample Input 1
2021 4

Sample Output 1
50531
Applying the operation on N=2021 results in N becoming 2021→2021200→10106→10106200→50531.

Sample Input 2
40000 2

Sample Output 2
1

Sample Input 3
8691 20

Sample Output 3
84875488281
The answer may not fit into the signed 32- bit integer type.
