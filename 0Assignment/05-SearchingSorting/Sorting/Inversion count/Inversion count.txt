Problem Statement
Calculate inversion count of array of integers.
Inversion count of an array is quantisation of how much unsorted an array is. A sorted array has inversion count 0, while an unsorted array has maximum inversion count.
Formally speaking inversion count = number of pairs i, j such that i < j and a[i] > a[j].

Input
The first line contain integers N.
The second line of the input contains N singly spaces integers.

1 <= N <= 100000
1 <= A[i] <= 1000000000

Output
Output one integer the inversion count.
