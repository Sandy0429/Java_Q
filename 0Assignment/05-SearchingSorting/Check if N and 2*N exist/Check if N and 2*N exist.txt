Problem Statement
Given an integer array A of size N. Find whether there exist two index i and j such that i != j and A[i] = 2 * A[j].

Input
First line contains an integer N.
Next line contains N space separated integers denoting elements of array.

Constraints
1 <= N <= 10^5
1 <= Ai <= 10^5

Output
Print "YES" if there exist two index i and j which fulfil the above constraints. Otherwise print "NO".

Example
Sample Input 1:
4
10 2 5 3

Output
YES

Explanation:
Both 5 and 10 are present in the array.

Sample Input 2:
