Problem Statement
Given an integer array A of size N. Find the sum of GCD (Greatest Common Divisor) of all elements with their frequency.

Input
First line contains an integers N.
Next line contains N space separated integers denoting elements of array.

Constraints
1 <= N <= 1000
0 <= Ai<= 10^5

Output
Print the sum of GCD of all elements with their frequency.

Example
Sample Input 1:
3
1 2 3

Output
3

Explanation:
gcd(1, 1) + gcd(2, 1) + gcd(3, 1) = 1+1+1 = 3

Sample Input 2:
6
3 6 6 9 3 3

Output
14

Explanation
gcd(3, 3) + gcd(6, 2) + gcd(6, 2) + gcd(9, 1) + gcd(3, 3) + gcd(3, 3)= 3+2+2+1+3+3= 14
