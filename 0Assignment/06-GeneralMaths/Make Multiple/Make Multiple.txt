Problem Statement
Shreya has two integers A and B (A ≤ B). Shreya can choose any non- negative integer X and add them to both A and B. Find whether it is possible to make A a divisor of B.

Input
The first line of input will contain a single integer T, denoting the number of test cases. Each test case consists of two integers A and B.

Constraints
1 ≤ T ≤ 105
1 ≤ A ≤ B ≤ 109

Output
For each test case, output YES if it is possible to make A a factor of B, NO otherwise.

Example
Sample Input :
3
3 6
4 14
9 10

Sample Output :
YES
YES
NO

Explanation :
We can choose X = 0 and add them to 3 and 6. Thus, 3 is a factor of 6.
We can choose X = 1 and add them to 4 and 14. Thus, 4 + 1 = 5 is a factor of 14 + 1 = 15.
There is no possible value of X to add such that A becomes a factor of B.
