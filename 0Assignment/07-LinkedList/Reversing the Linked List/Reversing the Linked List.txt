Reversing the Linked List
easy
asked in interviews by 8 companies

Problem Statement
Given a linked list of N nodes. The task is to reverse the list by changing links between nodes (i.e if the list is 1->2->3->4 then it becomes 1<-2<-3<-4) and return the head of the modified list.

Input
User Task:
Since this will be a functional problem, you don't have to take input. You just have to complete the function ReverseLinkedList that takes head node as parameter.

Constraints:
1 <=N <= 1000
1 <= Node.data<= 100

Output
Return the head of the modified linked list.

Example
Input-1:
6
1 2 3 4 5 6

Output-1:
6 5 4 3 2 1

Explanation:
After reversing the list, elements are as 6->5->4->3->2->1.

Input-2:
5
1 2 8 4 5

Output-2:
5 4 8 2 1
