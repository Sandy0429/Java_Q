Given an ArrayList of N lowercase characters. The task is to insert given elements in the list and count frequency of elements present in the list.

You can use some inbuilt functions as:-
add() to append element in the list
contains() to check an element is present or not in the list
collections.frequency() to find the frequency of the element in the list.

Input
User Task:
Since this will be a functional problem. You don't have to take input. You just have to complete the function insert() and freq() that takes the array list and the character c as parameters.

Constraints:
1 <= T <= 100
1 <= N <= 1000

c will be a lowercase english character

Output
