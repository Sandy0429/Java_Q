Problem Statement
You are given two binary strings of length N. You have to output a resultant string. The resultant string will be calculated in the following way:

- > For every position i, if the ith character of the first string is '1' and the second string is '0', the resultant string will have '1'. Also, for every position i, if the ith character of the first string is '0' and the second string is '1', the resultant string will have '1'. Rest, all the characters of the resultant string will be '0'. Find the resultant string;

Input
The first line of the input contains a single integer N.
The next two lines of the input will contain a string of size N each.

Constraints:
1 <= N <= 105
All characters of the string will be either '1' or '0'

Output
Print the resultant string.

Example
Sample Input:
5
10110
01101

Sample Output:
11011
