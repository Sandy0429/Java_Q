Problem Statement
Given a number N. Write a program to the find number of diagonals possible in N sided convex polygon.

Input
User Task:
Since this will be a functional problem, you don't have to take input. You just have to complete the function numberOfDiagonal() that takes the integer N parameter.

Constraints:
1 <= T <= 100
1 <= N <= 10^3

Output
Return number of diagonals possible in N sided convex polygon.

Example
Sample Input:
3
3
5
6

Sample Output:
0
5
9

Explanation:
For test case 2: The number of diagonals of 5 sided polygon: 5.
