Problem Statement
There are N buildings in a row with different heights H[i] (1 <= i <= N).
You are viewing the buildings from the left and you can see the roof of a building i if no building to the left of the ith building has a height greater than the ith building.
You are asked to find the number of buildings whose roofs you can see.

Input
The first line contains N denoting number of buildings.
The next line contains N space seperated integers denoting heights of the buildings from left to right.


Constraints
1 <= N <= 100000
1 <= H[i] <= 1000000000000000

Output
The output should contain one integer which is the number of buildings whose roofs you can see.

Example
Sample input:
5
1 2 2 4 3

Sample output:
3

Explanation:-
the building at index 3 will hide before building at index 2 and building at index 5 will hide before building at index 4
