Problem Statement
Given an integer N and an integer K, Your task is to multiply the first leftmost digit of the number to the number itself. You have to repeat this process K times.
For eg:- if N=3 and K=5 then:
3 * 3 = 9
9 * 9 = 81
81 * 8 = 648
648 * 6 = 3888
3888 * 3 = 11664

Input
User Task:
Since this will be a functional problem, you don't have to take input. You just have to complete the function KOperations() that takes the integer N as parameter.

Constraints:
1 <= N <= 100
1 <= K <= 10^9

Output
Return the Number after K operations

Note: It is guaranteed that the output will always be less than 10^17.

Example
Sample Input:-
3 5

Sample Output:-
11664

Explanation:- See problem statement for explanation.
