Problem Statement
You are given a positive integer A. You have to apply the following operation on it N times:
Let the maximum and minimum digits in the decimal representation of A be mx and mn respectively.
Add mx*mn to A, i. e, convert A to A + mx*mn.
Find the value of A after applying this operation N times.

Input
First and the only line of the input contains two integers A and N.

Constraints:
1 <= A <= 1018
1 <= N <= 1016

Output
Print the value of A after applying the above operation N times.

Example
Sample Input
8 3

Sample Output
134

Explaination:
During the first operation, mx = 8, mn = 8.
A = 8 + (8*8) = 8 + 64 = 72
During the second operation, mx = 7, mn = 2
A = 72 + (7*2) = 72 + 14 = 86
During the final operation, mx = 8, mn = 6
A = 86 + (8*6) = 86 + 48 = 134
