Problem Statement
Given an array A (0 indexed) of n integers from 0 to n-1 (each integer exactly once), output an array such that A[i] becomes A[A[i]].

Make sure you don't use extra memory than array itself.

Input
The first line of the input contains a number n, the number of integers in the array.
The second line of the input contains n numbers, the elements of A.

Constraints
1 <= n <= 100000
0 <= A[i] <= n-1

Output
Output the required array of n integers.
