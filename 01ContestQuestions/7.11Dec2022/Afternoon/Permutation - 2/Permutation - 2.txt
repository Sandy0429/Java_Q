Problem Statement
A ​ permutation is simply a name for a reordering. So the permutations of the string
‘abc’ are ‘abc’, ‘acb’, ‘bac’, ‘bca’, ‘cab’, and ‘cba’. Note that a sequence is a
permutation of itself (the trivial permutation). For this problem, you’ll need
to write a ​ recursive​ function ​​ that takes a string and returns a
list of all its permutations.
A couple of notes on the requirements:
1. The order of the returned permutations must be lexicographically.
2. Avoid returning duplicates in your final list.

Input
Input contains a single string S.

Constraints:-
1<=|S|<=8

Output
Print all the permutations of string S in lexicographical order.

Example
Sample Input:
ABC

Sample Output :
ABC ACB BAC BCA CAB CBA

Sample Input:
(T(

Sample Output:-
((T (T( T((
