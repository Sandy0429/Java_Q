Problem Statement
You are given two integers N and M (N > M). You have to find the smallest integer X such that N - M <= X <= N + M and M - X <= X - N

Input
First and the only line of the input contains two integers N and M.

Constraints:
1 <= N < M <= 109

Output
Find and print the smallest integer X which satisifes the above condition. If no such integer exists, print -1.

Example
Sample Input:
8 4

Sample Output:
8

Explaination:
6 is the smallest integer X between N - M (8 - 4 = 4) and N + M (8 + 4 = 12) such that M - X <= X - N.
