Problem Statement
You are asked Q questions. For each question, you have to determine whether the given number X can be represented as a sum of two or more consecutive positive integers. For example, the answer for X=9 is Yes as 9=2+3+4 while the answer for 2 is No (note that (−1)+0+1+2=2 is invalid as only positive integers are allowed).

Input
The first line contains a single integer, Q, denoting the number of questions
(1≤ Q ≤ 100).

In each of the next Q lines, a positive integer X is given (1 ≤ X ≤ 10^9).

Output
For each of the Q questions, print the answer in a single line: either Yes or No.
