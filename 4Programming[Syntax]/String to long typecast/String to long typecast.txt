Problem Statement
Given a String S, you need to typecast this String to Long. If the typecasting is done successfully then we will print "Nice Job" otherwise "Wrong answer".

Input
User task:
Since this is a functional problem you don't have to worry about the input. You just have to complete the function checkConvertion(), which contains S as parameter.

Constraints:-
1 <= |S| <= 15

The string will contain only numeric digits(1-9)

Output
You need to return the typecasted Long value. The driver code will print "Nice Job" otherwise "Wrong answer".

Note:- We are not converting this string to int here because the size of the number exceeds the int limits.
