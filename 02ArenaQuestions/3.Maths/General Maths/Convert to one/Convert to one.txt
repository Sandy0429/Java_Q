Problem Statement
Given a positive integer N. You can either multiply this integer by 2 or divide it by 6 (if N is fully divisible by 6) in one move. Find the minimum number of moves to convert N to 1. Print -1, if it is not possible.

Input
First and the only line of input contains an integer N.

Constraints
1 <= N <= 109

Output
Print the minimum number of moves to convert N to 1. Print -1, if it is not possible.

Example
Sample Input:
18

Sample Output:
3

Explaination:
In the first move, we multiply 18 by 2, N = 36.
Now we divide it by 6, N = 6.
We again divide it by 6, N = 1.
