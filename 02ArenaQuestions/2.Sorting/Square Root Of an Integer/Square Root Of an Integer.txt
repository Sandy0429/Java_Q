Problem Statement
Given an integer N. The task is to find the square root of N. If N is not a perfect square, then return floor(√N).

Try to solve the problem using Binary Search.

Input
The first line of input contains number of testcases T. For each testcase, the only line contains the number N.

Constraints:
1 ≤ T ≤ 10000
0 ≤ x ≤ 100000000

Output
For each testcase, print square root of given integer.

Example
Sample Input:
2
5
4

Sample Output:
2
2

Explanation:
Testcase 1: Since, 5 is not perfect square, so floor of square_root of 5 is 2.
Testcase 2: Since, 4 is a perfect square, so its square root is 2.
