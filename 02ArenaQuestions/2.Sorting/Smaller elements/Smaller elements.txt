Given a sorted array of N integers a[], and Q queries. For each query, you will be given a positive integer K and your task is to print the number of elements in array a[] that are smaller than or equal to K.

Input
In case of Java only

User Task:
Since this will be a functional problem, you don't have to take input. You just have to complete the function smallerElements() that takes the array a[], integer N and integer k as arguments.

Custom Input
The first line of input contains a single integer N.
The second line of input contains N space- separated integers depicting the values of the array.
The third line of input contains a single integer Q, the number of queries.
Each of the next Q lines of input contain a single integer, the value of K.

Constraints:-
1 <= N <= 105
1 <= K, Arr[i] <= 1012
1 <= Q <= 104

Output
Return the count of elements smaller than or equal to K.
