Problem Statement
Given a 2D integer array matrix or size n x n, print the transpose of the given matrix.

The transpose of a matrix is the matrix flipped over its main diagonal, switching the matrix's row and column indices.

Input
The first line of the input contains one integer, n, representing the size of the matrix. After that, n lines follow with n integers in each line representing the elements of the matrix.

Constraints
n == matrix.length
1 ≤ n ≤ 1000
-109 ≤ matrix[i][j] ≤ 109

Output
Output the transposed matrix after performing the operation

Example
Sample input:
3
1 2 3
4 5 6
7 8 9

Sample Output:
1 4 7
2 5 8
3 6 9
