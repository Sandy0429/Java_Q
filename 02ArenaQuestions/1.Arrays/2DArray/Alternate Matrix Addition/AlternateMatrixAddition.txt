Problem Statement
You are given a chessboard of size N x N, where the top left square is black. Each square contains a value. Find the sum of values of all black square and all white squares.

Remember that in a chessboard black and white squares alternate.

Input
The first line of input will be the N size of the matrix. Then next N lines will consist of elements of the matrix. Each row will contain N elements since it is a square matrix.

Constraints:-
1 <= N <= 800
1 <= Matrix[i][j] <= 100000

Output
Print two lines, first line containing the sum of black squares and second line containing the sum of white squares.

Example
Input:
3
1 2 3
4 5 6
7 8 9

Output:
25
20

Explanation:-
black square contains 1, 3, 5, 7, 9; sum = 25
white square contains 2, 4, 6, 8; sum = 20

Sample Input:
4
1 2 3 4
6 8 9 10
11 12 13 14
15 16 17 18

Sample Output:
80
79
