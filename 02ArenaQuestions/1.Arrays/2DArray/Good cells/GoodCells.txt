Problem Statement
Given a boolean Matrix of size N*M, A cell of the matrix is called "Good" if it is completely surrounded by the cells containing '1' i.e. each adjacent cell (which shares a common edge) contains '1'. Your task is to find the number of such cells.

See the below example for a better understanding

Input
First line of input contains two space- separated integers N and M. Next N lines of input contain M space- separated integers depicting the values of the matrix.

Constraints:-
3 <= N, M <= 500
0 <= Matrix[][] <= 1

Output
Print the number of good cells.

Example
Sample Input:-
3 3
1 1 0
1 1 1
1 1 1

Sample Output:-
1

Explanation:-
Only cell at position 1, 1 is good

Sample Input:-
5 4
1 0 1 0
0 1 0 1
1 0 1 0
0 1 0 1
1 0 1 0

Sample Output:-
3
