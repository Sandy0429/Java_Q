Memory Limit: 128000 kB

Problem Statement
Given a NxN matrix where matrix[i][j] = (i+j), 1<= i, j <= N.
Print the sum of all numbers at the main diagonal and anti diagonal.

NOTE: You must solve it in O(1) time complexity.

Input
The only line will contain a single integer N.

Constraints
1<= N <= 10^8

Output
A single integer denoting required sum.

Example
Input:
3

Output:
20

Explanation:
Matrix =>
2 3 4
3 4 5
4 5 6

Main diagonal => 2 + 4 + 6 = 12
Anti diagonal => 4 + 4 + 4 = 12
(2, 2) is common in both.
