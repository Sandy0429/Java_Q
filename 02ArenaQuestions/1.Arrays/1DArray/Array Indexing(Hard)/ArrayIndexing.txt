Problem Statement
You are given an array A of size N. Find the number of indexes i (1 <= i <= N) such that the sum of the elements to its right is atmost equal to the sum of elements to its left.

Input
The first line of input contains N, the size of the array.
The second line of input contains N space seperated integers Ai.

Constraints:
1 <= N <= 105
-109 <= Ai <= 109

Output
Print the number of indexes i (1 <= i <= N) such that the sum of the elements to its right is atmost equal to the sum of elements to its left.

Example
Sample Input:
5
3 -2 4 -1 4

Sample Output:
2
