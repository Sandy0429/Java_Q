Problem Statement
You are given an array of integers, marks, denoting the marks scored by students in a class.
The alternating elements marks0, marks2, marks4 and so on denote the marks of boys. Similarly, marks1, marks3, marks5 and so on denote the marks of girls.

Input
The first line contains number_of_students, denoting the number of students in the class, hence the number of elements in marks. Each of the number_of_students subsequent lines contains marks. The next line contains gender.

Constraints
1 ≤ number_of_students ≤ 103
1 ≤ marksi 103 (where 0 ≤ i ≤ number_of_students)
gender = g or b (g stands for girl and b stands for boy)

Output
Print the marks of the given query.

Example
Sample Input
3
3
2
5
b

Sample Output
8

Explanation
marks = [3, 2, 5] and gender = b.
So, marks0 + marks2 = 3 + 5 = 8.
