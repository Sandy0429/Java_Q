Problem Statement
Given an array Arr of N integers. Find the number of subarrays of this array which are powerful.

A subarray [L, R] (1 <= L <= R <= N) is said to be powerful if the product AL * AL+1 * ... * AR-1 * AR is odd.

Input
First line of input contains a single integer N
Second line of input contains N integers representing the elements of the array Arr


Constraints
1 <= N <= 100000
1 <= Arr[i] <= 100000

Output
Output the number of powerful subarrays of array Arr.

Example
Sample input 1
5
2 4 4 5 3

Sample output 1
3

Sample input 2
3
1 5 1

Sample Output 2
6

Explanation
Test Case1:- (3), (5), (3, 5) are the required subarrays.
Test Case2:- (1), (2), (1), (1, 5), (5, 1]) (1, 5, 1) are the required subarrays.
