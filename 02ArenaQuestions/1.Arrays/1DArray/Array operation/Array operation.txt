Problem Statement
Given an array of N non-negative integers. You perform the following operation on the array :
for every index i such that 0 < i < N, if arr[i] is even subtract the min(arr, 0, i-1) else if the arr[i] is odd add the max(arr, 0, i-1).

Where min(arr, 0, i) denotes the minimum of all elements of the array between 0 to i. similarly max(arr, 0, i) denotes the maximum in the given range.

print the maximum and minimum in the array.

Input
The first line contains N.
the second line contains N space-separated Integers.

Constraints
1 ≤ N ≤ 105
0 ≤ arr[i] ≤109

Output
Two integers denoting the maximum and minimum of the array after the operation.

Example
Input:
4
3 1 6 5

Output:
9 3

Explanation:
at index 1 : a[i] = 1, max = 3, min = 3 so a[i] = 1 + 3 = 4
at index 2 : a[i] = 6, max = 4 , min = 3 so a[i] = 6 - 3 = 3
at index 3 : a[i] = 5, max = 4 , min = 3 so a[i] = 5 +2 = 9
after operation : max= 9 min=3
