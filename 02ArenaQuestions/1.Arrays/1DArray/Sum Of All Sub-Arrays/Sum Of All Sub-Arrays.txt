Problem Statement
There is an integer array nums having n integers, given as input. Find the sum of all subarrays of given array nums and Return it.

Input
There is an integer n (size of array nums) given as input.
In the Second line, n space-separated integers are given as input.

Constraints
1 ≤ n ≤ 105
0 ≤ nums[i] ≤ 5*104
0 ≤ i ≤ n-1

Output
Return the sum of all the subarrays of given array nums.

Example
Sample Input:
3
1 2 3
Sample Output:
20

Explanation :
{1} + {2} + {3} + {2 + 3} + {1 + 2} + {1 + 2 + 3} = 20
