Problem Statement
There is an integer array nums having n integers, given as input. Find out whether the given array is spirally sorted or not.

Note:
An array nums, having N elements is spirally sorted if nums[0] ≤ nums[N – 1] ≤ nums[1] ≤ nums[N – 2] …

Input
An integer n (size of array nums) is given as input. In the Second line, n space-separated integers are given as input.

Constraints
1 ≤ n ≤ 105
0 ≤ nums[i] ≤ 5*104
0 ≤ i ≤ n-1

Output
Print "YES" if Array is Spirally sorted else "NO"(without quotes).

Example
Sample Input 1:
7
1 10 14 20 18 12 5

Sample Output 1:
YES

Explanation:
arr[0] < arr[6]
arr[1] < arr[5]
arr[2] < arr[4]
Therefore, the required output is YES.

Sample Input 2:
4
1 2 4 3

Sample Output 2:
NO
