Time Limit: 2 sec
Memory Limit: 128000 kB

Problem Statement
A left rotation operation on an array of size n shifts each of the array's elements 1 unit to the left. Given an integer, d, rotate the array that many steps left and return the result.

Example
d = 2
arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
arr' = [3, 4, 5, 1, 2]

Input
The first line contains two space- separated integers that denote n, the number of integers, and d, the number of left rotations to perform.
The second line contains n space- separated integers that describe arr[].

Constraints
1 ≤ n ≤ 105
1 ≤ d ≤ n
1 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 106

Output
Print the rotated array.

Example
Sample Input
5 4
1 2 3 4 5
Sample Output
5 1 2 3 4
Explanation
To perform d = 4 left rotations, the array undergoes the following sequence of changes:
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5] -> [2, 3, 4, 5, 1] -> [3, 4, 5, 1, 2] -> [4, 5, 1, 2, 3] -> [5, 1, 2, 3, 4]
