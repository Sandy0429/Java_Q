Array construction

Time Limit: 2 sec
Memory Limit: 128000 kB

Problem Statement
You are given two arrays - value and frequency both containing N elements.
There is also a third array C which is currently empty. Then you perform N insertion operation in the array. For ith operation you insert value[i] to the end of the array frequency[i] number of times.
Finally you have to tell the kth smallest element in the array C.

Input
First line of input contains N.
Second line contains N integers denoting array - value
Third line contains N integers denoting array - frequency
Fourth line contains single integer K.

Constraints
1 <= N, value[i], frequency[i] <= 100000
1 <= k <= frequency[1] + frequency[2] +frequency[3] +........ + frequency[N]

Output
Output a single integer which is the kth smallest element of the array C.

Example
Sample input 1
5
1 2 3 4 5
1 1 1 2 2
3

Sample output 1
3

Explanation 1:
Array C constructed is 1 2 3 4 4 5 5
Third smallest element is 3

Sample input 2
3
2 1 3
3 3 2
2

sample output 2
1

Explanation 2:
Array C constructed is 2 2 2 1 1 1 3 3
Second smallest element is 1
