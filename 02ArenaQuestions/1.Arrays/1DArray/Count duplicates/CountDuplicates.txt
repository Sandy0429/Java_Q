Problem Statement
Given an array of N elements, your task is to find the count of repeated elements. Print the repeated elements in ascending order along with their frequency.
Have a look at the example for more understanding.

Input
The first line of input contains a single integer N, the next line of input contains N space- separated integers depicting the values of the array.

Constraints:-
1 <= N <= 100000
1 <= Arr[i] <= 100000

Output
For each duplicate element in sorted order in a new line, First, print the duplicate element and then print its number of occurence space- separated.

Note:- It is guaranteed that at least one duplicate element will exist in the given array.

Example
Sample Input:-
5
3 2 1 1 2

Sample Output:-
1 2
2 2

Sample Input:-
5
1 1 1 1 5

Sample Output:-
1 4

Explaination:
test 1: Only 1 and 2 are repeated. Both are repeated twice. So, we print:
1 -> frequency of 1
2 -> frequency of 2
1 is printed before 2 as it is smaller than 2
