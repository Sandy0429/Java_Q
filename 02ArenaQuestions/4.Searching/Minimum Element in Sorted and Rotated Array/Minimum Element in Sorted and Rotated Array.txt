Problem Statement
Loki is one mischievous guy. He would always find different ways to make things difficult for everyone. After spending hours sorting a coded array of size N (in increasing order), you realise itâ€™s been tampered with by none other than Loki. Like a clock, he has moved the array thus tampering the data. The task is to find the minimum element in it.

Input
The first line of input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. Then T test cases follow. Each test case consist of two lines. The first line of each test case consists of an integer N, where N is the size of array.
The second line of each test case contains N space separated integers denoting array elements.

Constraints:
1 <= T <= 100
1 <= N <= 10^5
1 <= A[i] <= 10^6

Sum of "N" over all testcases does not exceed 10^5

Output
Corresponding to each test case, in a new line, print the minimum element in the array.

Example
Input:
3
10
2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 1
5
3 4 5 1 2
8
10 20 30 45 50 60 4 6

Output:
1
1
4

Explanation:
Testcase 1: The array is rotated once anti-clockwise. So minium element is at last index (n-1) which is 1.
Testcase 2: The array is rotated and the minimum element present is at index (n-2) which is 1.
Testcase 3: The array is rotated and the minimum element present is 4.
