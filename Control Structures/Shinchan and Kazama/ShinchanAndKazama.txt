Problem Statement
Shinchan and Kazama are standing in a horizontal line, Shinchan is standing at point A and Kazama is standing at point B. Kazama is very intelligent and recently he learned how to calculate the speed if the distance and time are given and now he wants to check if the formula he learned is correct or not So he starts running at a speed of S unit/s towards Shinhan and noted the time he reaches to Shinhan. Since Kazama is disturbed by Shinchan, can you calculate the time for him?

Input
The input contains three integers A, B, and S separated by spaces.

Constraints:-
1 <= A, B, V <= 1000

Note:- It is guaranteed that the calculated distance will always be divisible by V.

Output
Print the Time taken in seconds by Kazama to reach Shinchan.

Note:- Remember Distance can not be negative

Example
Sample Input:-
5 2 3

Sample Output:-
1

Explanation:-
Distance = 5-2 = 3, Speed = 3
Time = Distance/Speed

Sample Input:-
9 1 2

Sample Output:-
4
